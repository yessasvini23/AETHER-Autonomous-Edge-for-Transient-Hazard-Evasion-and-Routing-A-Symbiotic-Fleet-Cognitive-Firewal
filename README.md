## 🧠 Overview  

**AETHER** transforms traditional vehicles into a **collective cognitive fleet** using **Edge AI, mesh networking, and cloud intelligence**.  
It goes beyond isolated smart cars — creating a real-time, learning ecosystem where every vehicle **senses, predicts, and shares intelligence** to reduce hazards, emissions, and driver stress.  

> “From isolated vehicles to collective intelligence — where every car learns, protects, and evolves together.”

## 🚀 The Vision  

Mobility today is reactive — cars detect hazards **after** they happen.  
AETHER makes it **predictive and symbiotic**, enabling vehicles to form a **Cognitive Firewall** that shields drivers and cities from inefficiency, danger, and pollution.

## ⚙️ System Architecture  

AETHER operates through a **three-layer intelligent architecture**:

| Layer | Function | Key Components |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| 🧩 **Edge Node (Instinct)** | Processes real-time sensor data within each vehicle | NVIDIA Jetson Nano/Xavier, TensorFlow Lite, OBD-II, IR Camera |
| 🌐 **Mesh Network (Nervous System)** | Enables peer-to-peer sharing of processed insights | Wi-Fi HaLow / MQTT / C-V2X Simulation |
| ☁️ **Fleet Cloud (Brain)** | Aggregates fleet-wide data, trains predictive models | AWS IoT Core, SageMaker, DynamoDB |

## 🌟 Core Innovations  

### 🔹 1. Predictive Pothole & Road Damage Neutralization  
- Detects, classifies, and **predicts pothole evolution** using Edge AI.  
- Nearby vehicles receive optimized speed/angle suggestions for safe traversal.  
- Data shared with authorities for real-time infrastructure insights.  

### 🔹 2. Dynamic Emissions-Aero Routing  
- Models wind, gradient, and traffic to optimize **cooperative aerodynamics**.  
- Vehicles collaborate to reduce drag and fuel consumption.  

### 🔹 3. Proactive Driver Wellness & Safety Corridor  
- Monitors stress and fatigue using **biometric sensors** (HRV, eye saccades, grip pressure).  
- Automatically requests spatial “safety corridors” from nearby vehicles.  

### 🔹 4. Swarm Intelligence for Intersection Priority  
- Vehicles form temporary “AI swarms” to negotiate right-of-way.  
- Prioritizes emergency, EVs with low charge, and carpooling — reducing idle emissions.

## 🧩 Process Flow  

1. Vehicle sensors collect real-time data (road, driver, and environment).  
2. Edge AI module detects anomalies and driver fatigue.  
3. Vehicles share **insights (not raw data)** through a mesh network.  
4. Cloud AI updates global models → pushes improvements fleet-wide.  
5. Continuous feedback loop enhances safety and sustainability.
